          Hello, my name is Abdul malik, and my internet name is up2dul. I am a
          20 y.o man from Jakarta, Indonesia. I have been interested and
          passionate in programming since 2019, precisely when I was in high
          school. What made me interested was when I saw the chatbot on the LINE
          application, and then I am exploring how to make it on the internet,
          in the end, I did it (even mine was a very simple chatbot). After
          that, I focus diving into web programming then.

          After graduated from high school in 2020, I got a job to make a
          company profile website for a company at near of my home. I built the
          website using MongoDB as the database, and Next.js v.9 with Static
          Site Generation fetching method for a better SEO. I built the website
          for about 2 months (August 2020 - October 2020).
          <br />
          After completing the website, I remained employed at that company but
          in a role outside of my field. Initially, I balanced work with
          learning programming at home, but eventually, the demands of work
          consumed all my time, causing me to lose focus on my learning. In
          2022, I attempted to return to focus on learning programming, until I
          resigned in October 2022 to prioritize my learning.
          <br />I am currently focusing on expanding my knowledge and skills in
          React.js, Next.js, Typescript, and related Frontend technologies by
          learning from official documentation, articles, videos on YouTube, as
          well as online courses. I also practice by creating and working on
          various projects and apps, I put these in{' '}
          <Link href='/projects' className='text-link'>
            here
          </Link>
          .

          Apart from programming, one of the things I enjoy is reading books
          (even though I may not be as consistent with it currently). My reading
          preference mostly lies in novels, specifically those written by Tere
          Liye. These books by Tere Liye are truly fantastic and always leave me
          wanting to purchase more of his books.
