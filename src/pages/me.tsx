          Hello, my name is <S>Abdul malik</S>, and my internet name is{' '}
          <S>up2dul</S>. I am a 20 y.o man from Jakarta, Indonesia. I have been
          interested and passionate in programming since 2019, precisely when I
          was in high school. What made me interested was when I saw the chatbot
          on the LINE application, and then I am exploring how to make it on the
          internet, in the end, I did it (even mine was a very simple chatbot).
          After that, I focus diving into <S>web programming</S> then.

          After graduated from high school in 2020, I got a job to make a{' '}
          <S>company profile website</S> for a company at near of my home. I
          built the website using MongoDB as the database, and Next.js v.9 with
          Static Site Generation strategy for a better SEO. I built the website
          for about 2 months (August 2020 - October 2020).
          <br />
          After completing the website, I remained employed at that company but
          in a role outside of programming. At first, I balanced work with
          learning programming at home, but eventually, the demands of work
          consumed all my time, causing me to lose focus on my learning. In
          2022, I attempted to return to focus on learning programming, until I
          resigned in October 2022 to prioritize my learning.
          <br />I am currently focusing on expanding my knowledge and skills in
          <S> React.js, Next.js, Typescript,</S> and related Frontend
          technologies by learning from official documentation, articles, videos
          on YouTube, and online courses as well. I also practice by creating on
          various{' '}

          Apart from programming, one of the things I enjoy is reading books
          (even though I may not be as consistent with it currently). My reading
          preference mostly are novels, specifically those written by Tere Liye.
          These books by Tere Liye are truly fantastic and always leave me
          wanting to purchase more of his books.
