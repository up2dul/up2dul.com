          Hello, my name is <S>Abdul malik</S>, and my internet name is{' '}
          <S>up2dul</S>. I am a 20 y.o man from Jakarta, Indonesia. I have been
          interested and passionate in programming since 2019, precisely when I
          was in high school. What made me interested was when I saw the chatbot
          on the LINE application, and then I am exploring how to make it on the
          internet, in the end, I did it (even mine was a very simple chatbot).
          After that, I focus diving into <S>web programming</S> then.

          After graduated from high school in 2020, I got a job to make a{' '}
          <S>company profile website</S> for a company at near of my home. I
          built the website using MongoDB as the database, and Next.js v.9 with
          Static Site Generation strategy for a better SEO. I built the website
          for about 2 months (August 2020 - October 2020).
          <br />
          After completing the website, I remained employed at that company but
          in a role outside of programming. At first, I balanced work with
          learning programming at home, but eventually, the demands of work
          consumed all my time, causing me to lose focus on my learning. In
          2022, I attempted to return to focus on learning programming, until I
          resigned in October 2022 to prioritize my learning.
          <br />I am currently focusing on expanding my knowledge and skills in
          <S> React.js, Next.js, TypeScript,</S> and related Frontend
          technologies by learning from official documentation, articles, videos
          on YouTube, and online courses as well. I also practice by creating on
