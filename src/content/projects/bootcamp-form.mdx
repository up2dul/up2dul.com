### ðŸ“„ About

My practice about creating multi step form with React Hook Form and Yup as validation.
This website takes a case study of Bootcamp registration.

### ðŸ†• New things I have learned

From this project, I learned how to use Mantine UI as UI library, React Hook Form to simplify building form along with Yup as the input validation.
I learned how to use Zustand as well, it was a simple and easy to use state management.
